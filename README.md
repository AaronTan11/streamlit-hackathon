# streamlit-hackathon

Follow this link to the deployed project https://hackapu.streamlit.app/

This chatbot can generate image, in order to do that you have to start your prompt with `generate` follow by your prompt for image you want.

This project uses the models from huggingface, `facebook/blenderbot-400M-distill` for conversation and `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 for image generation`.
